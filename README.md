# T-Display_E-Paper_SD_Example
My mashup of Xinyuan-LilyGO / LilyGo-T5-Epaper-Series SD_Example sketch to add SD Card Reader to the T-Display E-Paper v1.02.

New LilyGo T-Display E-Paper.


This is too cute to pass up. You know how much I enjoy the LilyGo TTGO T-Display.  Well this is the LilyGo T-Display E-Paper. Let's see how to make it work. Make sure to watch all the way to the end because I show how to connect an SD card reader to this T-Display E-Paper. The T-Display E-Paper is the same form factor and pinout as the original T-Display. But there is an important difference. The T-Display E-Paper uses this T-U2T USB to TTL dongle for uploading programs to the board. Make sure to get one of these when you get the T-Display E-Paper.
Check out all my adventures working with the TTGO T-Display.

Actually when scrolling down in the readme you see they want you to use the lewisxhe fork of the GxEPD library.

The xinyuan lilygo ttgo t-display library has sd card examples using pins 25, 26, 27 and 33 on the T-Display.
